[SPGI 2018 Summer] - Project: A Tutorial to Web Applications Using Python Flask and How to Deploy Them to the Cloud
- A tutorial where we go use Python and Flask to create a simple web application and deploy them to the cloud

# Summary
- During my internship, I was tasked with learning about Containers and how to implement them using Docker

- Throughout the tutorials for Docker, I noticed that they always used Flask to create a web application and use it to run a container. In 
order to understand these tutorials better, I decided to learn Flask

- I also had to deploy it to the cloud. I used Google App Engine for that

- After learning how to use Flask and use Google App Engine to deploy them to the cloud. I wanted to teach others who might get stuck just like
I did.
